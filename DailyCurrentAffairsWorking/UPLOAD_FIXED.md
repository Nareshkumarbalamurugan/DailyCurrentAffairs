# 🎉 File Upload Fix Applied!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The file upload was hanging because **expo-image-picker doesn't work in web browsers**. I've added web-compatible file selection that works in your browser.

## 🔧 Changes Made

1. **Web File Picker**: Added native HTML file input for web browsers
2. **Platform Detection**: Automatically uses the right picker for each platform
3. **Blob URL Handling**: Properly handles web file objects
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed console output for debugging

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Open Admin Panel** (password: `admin123`)
2. **Switch to "Upload" tab** in media section
3. **Click "Choose Media"**
4. **Select "Choose Image" or "Choose Video"**
5. **Pick a file from your computer**
6. **Watch console for upload progress**
7. **See preview and publish article**

## 📱 Platform Support

- **Web Browser**: ✅ File picker dialog
- **Mobile App**: ✅ Gallery + Camera access
- **Desktop**: ✅ File system access

## 🔍 Console Output

You'll now see detailed logs like:
